## Notes | Challenges

* Was confused on how to start the project, but I began building it like I did in the lab.
* Wasn't sure how to make a grid, so I used the table format from the lab and formed it to be like a grid. Each language had it's own data cell.
* Got confused on how to make a component, so I referred to the lab, made the component as a description for each language, and added different links to each data cell using props functionality.
